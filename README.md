# Split Sprites

Very simple script for carving up image file into tiles.

## Usage

```
spriteSlice [target image filename] [tile width] [tile height]
```

The script will create a new directory and save tiles there.

## Limitations

- Only supports png at the moment.
- Only supports cutting regular sized tiles (no searching for transparancy, etc)
